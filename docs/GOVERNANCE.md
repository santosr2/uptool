## Overview

uptool follows a **trunk-based development** workflow with transparent decision-making and community-first principles.

### Key Principles

- **Trunk-Based Development**: All changes merge directly to `main` after review
- **No Git Flow**: Simple, fast-moving development process
- **Community First**: Open discussion and transparent decision-making
- **Quality Standards**: Comprehensive testing and code review requirements

### Roles

- **Maintainers**: Core team members with write access
- **Contributors**: Community members who submit pull requests
- **Users**: Anyone using uptool in their projects

### Decision Making

- **Minor Changes**: Approved by any maintainer
- **Major Changes**: Require discussion and consensus
- **Breaking Changes**: Require RFC and community feedback

### Pull Request Process

1. Fork and create a feature branch
2. Make changes with tests
3. Submit PR with clear description
4. Address review feedback
5. Maintainer merges after approval
