# OSV Scanner Configuration
# https://google.github.io/osv-scanner/configuration/

# What we scan:
# - ./go.mod                                   - Production Go dependencies (auto-finds go.sum)
# - ./docs/requirements.txt                    - Documentation build dependencies (MkDocs, etc.)
#
# What we DON'T scan:
# - examples/                                  - Example code (not production dependencies)
# - testdata/                                  - Test fixtures (not production code)
# - .mise/                                     - Tool cache (development tools only)
#
# The workflow uses explicit --lockfile flags to scan specific dependency files,
# avoiding recursive filesystem traversal that would pick up test data and examples.
#
# Note: For Go modules, we only specify go.mod - OSV scanner automatically finds
# and uses the corresponding go.sum file in the same directory.

# Example: Ignore specific vulnerabilities (if needed in future)
# [[IgnoredVulns]]
# id = "GO-2024-XXXX"
# reason = "False positive - only affects development tools"

# Example: Package overrides (if needed in future)
# [[PackageOverrides]]
# name = "example-package"
# version = "1.0.0"
# ecosystem = "Go"
