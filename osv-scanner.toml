# OSV Scanner Configuration
# https://google.github.io/osv-scanner/configuration/

# What we scan:
# - go.mod:go.sum                              - Production Go dependencies
# - docs/requirements.txt                      - Documentation build dependencies (MkDocs, etc.)
# - examples/plugins/python/go.mod:go.sum      - Plugin example dependencies (educational code)
#
# What we DON'T scan:
# - examples/plugins/python/testdata/          - Test fixtures (not production code)
# - testdata/                                  - Test fixtures (not production code)
# - .mise/                                     - Tool cache (development tools only)
#
# The workflow uses explicit --lockfile flags to scan specific dependency files,
# avoiding recursive filesystem traversal that would pick up test data.

# Example: Ignore specific vulnerabilities (if needed in future)
# [[IgnoredVulns]]
# id = "GO-2024-XXXX"
# reason = "False positive - only affects development tools"

# Example: Package overrides (if needed in future)
# [[PackageOverrides]]
# name = "example-package"
# version = "1.0.0"
# ecosystem = "Go"
